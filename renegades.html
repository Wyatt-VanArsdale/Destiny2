<h1>Current Expansion: Renegades</h1>
<br>
<h2 style="text-align:left">The Latest Expansion in Destiny 2 has arrived recently, called "Renegades". Being a collaboration with star wars, it takes heavy inspriation from that universe with new blaster weapons, and the praxic blade, which is Destiny's equivalent to a lightsaber. </h2>

<h2 style="text-align:left">Here is some important information about the Expansion without any spoilers:
<br>
<h2 style="text-align:left">The main enemy is Dredgen Bael - who is a wielder of the darkness - and is essentially an 'enemy guardian' (which is what a Dredgen is)
<h2 style="text-align:left">The new destination in this expansion is called the Lawless Frontier. This is a mix of other destinations - where there are specific activities that you are able to do that are tied to the expansion and give loot.
<h2 style="text-align:left">In these new activities you are able to use things called renegade abilities - which are special abilities that provide various benefits, like calling in ammo, or summoning a walker like vehicle for you to pilot and fight in.
<h2 style="text-align:left">One of the main selling points is the 'Praxic Blade' which is essentially a lightsaber in Destiny 2. It is very powerful, fun, and unique.
<h2 style="text-align:left">This expansion is $40
<br>
<h2 style='text-align:left'>Overall, Renegades is a step up from the previous expansion, Edge of Fate, in terms of quality, story, and gameplay.
